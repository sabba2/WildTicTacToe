# WildTicTacToe

The project aims to align with Object Oriented Design principles and apply design patterns such as abstract factory, command, and template method patterns.

A CRC table, OMT class diagram, object diagrams and sequence diagrams were developed to guide the implementation. 

Requirements met include:
•	An extensible framework of classes that can be extended to many different two-player board games.
•	An extension of this framework to a specific implementation of the game Wild Tic-Tac-Toe
•	The ability to choose different game modes, including human versus human and human versus computer.
•	Moves entered by humans are validated by the system before being placed on the board.
•	Computers randomly select valid moves to make on the board.
•	Games can be played from start to finish.
•	All moves made by both players are undoable and redoable as the full history of moves are tracked.
•	An online help system exists that is accessible while running the game and is able to assist users by entering the available commands. Users can also list view available commands.
•	The game is played via a command-line interface and the board representation is displayed after every turn.
